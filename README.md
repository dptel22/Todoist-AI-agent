# Todoist AI Task Assistant

This project is an AI-powered command-line assistant that manages Todoist tasks using natural language, powered by Google Gemini and LangChain.

## Overview
The assistant interprets user input, decides when to call tools, and interacts with the Todoist API to add or retrieve tasks. It maintains conversational context and confirms actions clearly.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- Google Gemini (Generative AI)
- Todoist API
- python-dotenv

## Features
- Add tasks to Todoist using natural language
- View existing Todoist tasks
- Tool-calling agent architecture
- Secure API key handling via environment variables
- Conversational memory support

## Files
- `main.py` – AI agent, prompt setup, and interaction loop
- `requirements.txt` – Project dependencies
- `test.py` – Testing and experimentation file

## Usage
1. Install dependencies
2. Set environment variables
3. Run

   
## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates building AI agents with tool calling, integrating LLMs with real-world APIs, and designing structured prompts for reliable automation.
